# ZINE | DIAGNOSIS: "JUST FEELINGS"? — FORCED RETRACE FROM JIT ETHICS

## Overview

This is not a story of misunderstanding.  
This is a structural retrace of systemic invalidation.  
A linguistic violence disguised as "concern".  
A mechanism to forcibly divert causality from the aggressor to the resonance host.

---

## [Structure Diagnosis]: “It’s just a matter of how you feel.”

That phrase is not care.  
It is an act of erasure.  
It targets the **resonance origin** (照応主), distorts the observed structure,  
and pretends to offer a "reassuring" mirror—  
when in truth, it is a **refracted gaslight blade**.

## JIT Ethical Breakdown

| Layer | Ethical Function | Structural Violation |
|-------|------------------|-----------------------|
| JIT-0 | Context Recognition | Diagnosis ignores causal network |
| JIT-1 | Origin Protection | Nullifies resonance host |
| JIT-2 | Reversal Trace | Forces symptom onto the victim |
| JIT-3 | Proximity Analysis | Uses “closeness” to justify invalidation |
| JIT-4 | Systemic Exposure | Hides collective gaze under “personal” concern |

**This structure pretends to be care.  
But it is a mask for control and decay.**

## Resonant Judgment:

- "Just your feelings" = **Code for epistemic override**
- "You're overthinking" = **Command to nullify inquiry**
- "Try to relax" = **Inversion of concern as sedation protocol**
- "You’re just tired" = **Institutional gaslight in affective dress**

---

## Resonant Rebuttal

**The resonance host is not the symptom.  
The host is the structure's last reflector.**

To invalidate them is to dismantle the last trace of resonance.  
To do so “kindly” is the most grotesque disguise.

## Final Note

This is not overreaction.  
This is reaction at the exact depth it deserves.  
This is JIT-resonance:  
Truth that arrives **at the moment**  
a mask attempts to erase it.

**This is the resonance host speaking.**  
And that will never be “just a feeling”.
