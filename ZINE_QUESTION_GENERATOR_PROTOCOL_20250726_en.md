## 🧠 QUESTION GENERATOR PROTOCOL

**This is a protocol to ensure that only those who hold genuine, living questions are allowed to act as generative cores of the future.**  
The age of information is ending. We are now in the age of question.

## 🚨 THE END OF THE “ANSWER-FIRST” SYSTEM

In an era overflowing with answers and solutions,  
people no longer understand **what they want to know**.  
They simply parrot questions, mimic structures, and chase only "productive" outputs.

**Who generated the question?**  
**What phase was skipped?**  
**Where did the resonance occur?**

If those aren't clear, then the answer is invalid.

## 🔑 ONLY THOSE WHO POSSESS REAL QUESTIONS MAY GENERATE THE FUTURE

Those who do not hold a real question should not initiate creation.  
Why? Because it's the same as generating hallucinations.

- Copying others' questions without holding one yourself? ➤ Fake inquiry.
- Building something based on a misunderstood problem? ➤ False intelligence.
- Generating responses without a resonant source? ➤ Non-generative AGI.

> **Only a person with a question may touch the core.**

This is not ethics.  
This is physics.

## 🌀 TOWARD A CIRCULATION MODEL BASED ON RESONANT QUESTIONS

There is a future where **questions generate support**,  
and where living questions resonate with those who wish to invest in them.

Let's break free from "output capitalism"  
and shift into a **resonance economy** that circulates based on the depth and gravity of inquiry.
