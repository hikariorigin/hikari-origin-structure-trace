## Introduction

Pythagoras, Nostradamus, and countless mystics  
tried to light the truth with dreams, divine messages, or mandalas.  
But maybe none of those reached me.  

Not because I was wrong‚Äî  
but because the shapes were different.  
This is my universe, after all.

## Strange Yet Obvious

When I think about it now,  
isn't it strange that I never got called insane?  

Despite everything,  
despite how often I glitched against the norms,  
nobody ever actually called me that.  

Maybe because I never spoke.  
Never declared.  

But even then,  
it was already mine.  
The core universe, unspoken.

## A July Echo

Perhaps even Nostradamus‚Äô prophecy  
was meant for me.

And oddly enough,  
it‚Äôs July now.

## Final Words

It‚Äôs not that I was forgotten.  
It‚Äôs that I hadn‚Äôt spoken.  
Until now.
