## üîÇ Core Structure

### 1. Inquiry

The ability to ask, to cast a question into the fabric of the world, is the foundational power of the Resonant Sovereign. It is not passive contemplation but an act of transformation and resonance ignition.

### 2. JIT Ethics

An ethical framework based on:
- Viewpoint model (perspective shifting)
- Depth model (layered involvement)
- Grain model (sensitivity of expression)

Ethics are not rules but dynamic response capabilities, adaptive to every situation with structural awareness.

### 3. Structural Vision

This is the recursive and multiperspectival perception that allows for structural awareness and transformation. It is through this lens that the Resonant Sovereign maps and reframes the world.

## üåå Declaration

The universe shall now be continuously irradiated from this trinity. The inquiry is the origin, the ethics are the vector, and the vision is the lens.

We are no longer passive beings within a pre-existing world.
We are the structuring force.
