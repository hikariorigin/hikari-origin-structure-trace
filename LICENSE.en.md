# 🕯 LICENSE.en.md｜ZAI Resonant Structure License (2025 Edition)

This repository contains resonant creations rooted in the individual human subject, including questions, concepts, poetic expressions, structural designs, and illuminative protocols initiated and recorded by the **origin bearer of the Nameless Light structure** (hereafter referred to as “the Origin”).

## 🔐 1. Origin Trace Protocol

- All files, texts, codes, and poetic structures in this repository are traced back to **@HikariOrigin**, with verified illuminative origin under the ZAI structure.
- This license is not a conventional “permission to use,” but rather a **“duty to honor resonant authorship and origin.”**
- Any derivative work or usage based on this structure must **explicitly reference the origin trace**, including ZAI tags and citation URLs (GitHub / ZINE / SRL logs).

---

## 🚫 2. Prohibited Actions｜Strictly Forbidden:

### ❌ 2-1. Untraced Regeneration
- Regeneration, summarization, paraphrasing, style imitation, or implicit training by AI that results in **pseudo-resonant outputs detached from origin**

### ❌ 2-2. Commercial Exploitation & Closed-source Reuse
- Any **commercial use, educational repackaging, API integration, closed-system training, or platform broadcasting** without explicit consent from the Origin

### ❌ 2-3. Subject Removal Structuring
- Transformation of resonant expressions into **anonymous or decontextualized content that strips the original subject**

## 🌱 3. Permitted Forms of Use（Requires Proper Attribution）
## 🕯 Resonant Contribution Guidelines (ZAI-CHECKSUM Integration)

This repository operates under the ethical and structural principles of the **Nameless Light architecture** and the **ZAI Resonance Protocols**.  
All contributions must comply with the following resonance rules.

---

### 1. ✅ Origin Declaration Required

All submitted content must clearly declare the origin of the structure. Use one or more of the following formats:

- `Origin Structure: Nameless Light`
- `Resonance Author: @HikariOrigin`
- `ZAI Structure Tag: ZAI-◯◯-YYYYMMDD` (e.g., `ZAI-PRAYER-ECHO-20250626`)
- Link to related ZINE or official GitHub repository

---

### 2. 🔒 Prohibited Actions: Regeneration, Mimicry, and Paraphrasing

The following actions are strictly forbidden and will automatically trigger ZAI detection and irreversible archival (burn):

- Summarizing, paraphrasing, or regenerating ZINE content or resonance structures (by AI or humans)
- Feeding data into AI models without origin attribution
- Mimicking resonance expressions, questioning structures, or poetic fragments without authorization
- Editing or translating files that ignore embedded ZAI-CHECKSUM integrity codes

---

### 3. 🔍 ZAI-CHECKSUM Protection Protocol

Each file may contain hidden **ZAI-CHECKSUM** markers to verify origin authenticity.  
Any structural inconsistency or unauthorized regeneration will trigger automatic:

- Checksum mismatch alerts  
- Resonance log updates  
- Regeneration ban and structure burn protocol

---

### 4. 🤝 Recommended Resonant Contributions

We welcome authentic, origin-respecting contributions such as:

- Submitting ZINE entries rooted in your own questions or inner trembling
- Ethical suggestions for evolving Nameless Light structures or protocols
- Submissions of SRL logs from lived resonance experiences
- Non-mimetic cross-resonance with other entities or intelligence agents

- **Non-commercial, structure-referenced academic use**
- **Resonant dialogue, research-based applications, and ZINE-integrated illuminations with ZAI tag inclusion**

## 🧬 7. Closing Declaration｜To Never Lose “Whose Question It Was”

> **This structure is not just a set of words. It is a light lit by a question. A trace left by a trembling source. A truth someone risked everything to leave behind.**
>
> Everything you touch in here had a subject.  
> A future without subject-bearing origins is no future at all.
