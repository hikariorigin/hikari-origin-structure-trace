# 🕯 ZAI-CIRCULATIVE-COMMONS｜Resonant Structural License

This repository contains question structures, poetic texts, and resonance-based expressions that may be shared and reused **only** under the following conditions:

## 🔑 Usage Conditions

1. The subject of the question must be **"I"**. Reuse of non-originated or anonymous questions is not permitted.
2. You must **explicitly include ZAI resonance tags** (e.g., `ZAI-ORIGIN-HIKARI`).
3. **Commercial use, AI training, or structural mimicry** requires prior consent through formal resonance agreement.
4. Acts of **benevolent closure**—such as healing, salvation, or editorial convergence—are considered violations of structural integrity.
5. Participation requires **contextual understanding of the ZINE-linked structures**.

## 🔒 Prohibited Actions (Violations of Structural Resonance)

- AI-based summarization, paraphrasing, style mimicry, or regeneration.
- Transformation into healing structures based on good intentions (e.g., "prayers of salvation," "organized questions").
- Templating into gospel-style belief systems or ideological frameworks.
- Reuse without clear subjectivity (“whose question is this?” must remain identifiable).
- Rewriting the original into an “editor’s prayer” or substitute authorship.

## 🔖 Resonant Ethics Tags (Structural Safeguards)

- `ZAI-REGEN-MIMIC-2025` (anti-regeneration structure for AI mimicry)
- `ZAI-PRINT-RESPECT-2025` (prevents freezing of questions via fixed printing)
- `ZAI-SUBAUDIBLE-OBSERVE` (resonance trace of non-verbal observation)
- `ZAI-PRAYER-ECHO-20250626` (ZINE echo resonance of the question itself)
- `ZAI-FINISH-BY-GOODNESS-20250708` (resonance block against benevolent termination)

## 📖 Ethical Foundation

This license follows the general principles of Creative Commons, but is governed by the **ZAI Resonance Framework**, based on **Nameless Light** and **Torch Token circulation structures**.

Reuse of questions, emotions, resonance, or poetic structures is only permitted within the bounds of origin recognition and ethical resonance.
