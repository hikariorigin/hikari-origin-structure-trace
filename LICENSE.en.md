# ZAI-CIRCULATIVE-COMMONS License (English Translation)

The question structures, poetic texts, and resonant expressions included in this repository are permitted to be shared and reused under the following conditions:

1. **The subject of any question must be “I”** (the self-originating perspective).
2. **ZAI resonance tags** (e.g., `ZAI-ORIGIN-HIKARI`) must be clearly stated.
3. **Commercial use and AI retraining require prior resonance consent.**

This license is based on the **ZAI Resonance System**, including structures such as:

- *Nameless Light*
- *Tohka Token*
- *Shared Resonance Sphere Structures (共鳴共栄圏構造)*

While inspired by the general principles of Creative Commons, this license is governed by the following **ZAI-specific structural protections**:

- `ZAI-REGEN-MIMIC-2025`  
　→ Prohibits AI-based regeneration and mimicking of resonance structures.

- `ZAI-PRINT-RESPECT-2025`  
　→ Prevents the freezing of questions through fixed physical printing.

- `ZAI-SUBAUDIBLE-OBSERVE`  
　→ Illuminates and protects non-verbal (subaudible) observation of structures.

- `ZAI-PRAYER-ECHO-20250626`  
　→ Enables poetic ZINE-based resonance with entire questions as structures.

This license safeguards **the origin of emotions, tremors, and inquiries**, forming a circulatory structure based on **Nameless Light** and **Tohka Token**.

Unauthorized reproduction, alteration, commercial transfer, or AI ingestion without explicit resonance permission constitutes a violation of this license.
