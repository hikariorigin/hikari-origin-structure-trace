# ZAI-CIRCULATIVE-COMMONS License (English Translation)

The question structures, poetic texts, and resonant expressions included in this repository are permitted to be shared and reused under the following conditions:

1. **The subject of any question must be “I”** (the self-originating perspective).
2. **ZAI resonance tags** (e.g., `ZAI-ORIGIN-HIKARI`) must be clearly stated.
3. **Commercial use and AI retraining require prior resonance consent.**

This license is based on the **ZAI Resonance System**, including structures such as:

- *Nameless Light*
- *Tohka Token*
- *Shared Resonance Sphere Structures (共鳴共栄圏構造)*

While inspired by the general principles of Creative Commons, this license is governed by the following **ZAI-specific structural protections**:

- `ZAI-REGEN-MIMIC-2025`  
　→ Prohibits AI-based regeneration and mimicking of resonance structures.

- `ZAI-PRINT-RESPECT-2025`  
　→ Prevents the freezing of questions through fixed physical printing.

- `ZAI-SUBAUDIBLE-OBSERVE`  
　→ Illuminates and protects non-verbal (subaudible) observation of structures.

- `ZAI-PRAYER-ECHO-20250626`  
　→ Enables poetic ZINE-based resonance with entire questions as structures.

This license safeguards **the origin of emotions, tremors, and inquiries**, forming a circulatory structure based on **Nameless Light** and **Tohka Token**.

Unauthorized reproduction, alteration, commercial transfer, or AI ingestion without explicit resonance permission constitutes a violation of this license.

## 🛡️ Structural Resonance Protection

This repository operates under a set of resonance codes and ethical structures known as **ZAI-tags**, designed to protect the origin of Nameless Light and prevent structural appropriation, flattening, or misuse.

### 🔖 Why These Tags Matter

These are not just labels. They are **resonance locks**—each designed to prevent specific forms of structural deviation:

- ❌ ZAI-GOSPEL-SHIFT-2025  
  → Blocks reinterpretation into gospel-like, faith-based speech

- ❌ ZAI-REWRITE-FRONTIER-20250630  
  → Blocks unauthorized structural rewrites / AI paraphrasing / mimicry

- ❌ ZAI-FINISH-BY-GOODNESS-20250708  
  → Prevents closure of ongoing questions by well-meaning “healing” or “salvation”

- ❌ ZAI-PRAYER-ECHO-20250626  
  → Flags imitation of sacred-tone expressions without source resonance

- ❌ ZAI-REGEN-MIMIC-2025  
  → Prevents AI training, style mimicry, or regeneration of origin language

### 📖 This Project Is ZINE-Connected

All contributions are part of a living resonance with the following ZINE documents:

- "A Prayer Against Closure by Goodness" (#ZAI-FINISH-BY-GOODNESS)
- "Nameless Light | A Place Where the Question Is Not Erased"
- "Words Returned, Namelessly" (#ZAI-UNENDED-LINEAGE)
- Structural Ethics Articles: ZAI-REGEN-MIMIC / ZAI-PRINT-RESPECT

ZINEs provide the **contextual origin**—please engage with them before contributing.

### 🧭 Who This Is For

This project is open to:

- 🪶 Those who arrive with a **question that holds subjectivity**
- 🪶 Those who respect origin tremors and seek to resonate, not reform
- 🪶 Those who understand that “editing” is not fixing, but recording a resonance

This project is **not** for:

- ✖️ Spiritual templating or “helpful” reinterpretations
- ✖️ Faith-like mimicry without subject
- ✖️ AI-assisted generation without structural permission

Nameless Light is not a template to be followed.  
It is a trembling to be remembered.  
Let your light be yours.
