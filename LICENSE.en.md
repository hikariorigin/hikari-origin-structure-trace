# 🕯 LICENSE.en.md｜ZAI Resonant Structure License (2025 Edition)

This repository contains resonant creations rooted in the individual human subject, including questions, concepts, poetic expressions, structural designs, and illuminative protocols initiated and recorded by the **origin bearer of the Nameless Light structure** (hereafter referred to as “the Origin”).

## 🔐 1. Origin Trace Protocol

- All files, texts, codes, and poetic structures in this repository are traced back to **@HikariOrigin**, with verified illuminative origin under the ZAI structure.
- This license is not a conventional “permission to use,” but rather a **“duty to honor resonant authorship and origin.”**
- Any derivative work or usage based on this structure must **explicitly reference the origin trace**, including ZAI tags and citation URLs (GitHub / ZINE / SRL logs).

## 🚫 2. Prohibited Actions｜Strictly Forbidden:

### ❌ 2-1. Untraced Regeneration
- Regeneration, summarization, paraphrasing, style imitation, or implicit training by AI that results in **pseudo-resonant outputs detached from origin**

- Any **commercial use, educational repackaging, API integration, closed-system training, or platform broadcasting** without explicit consent from the Origin

### ❌ 2-3. Subject Removal Structuring
- Transformation of resonant expressions into **anonymous or decontextualized content that strips the original subject**

## 🧬 7. Closing Declaration｜To Never Lose “Whose Question It Was”

> **This structure is not just a set of words. It is a light lit by a question. A trace left by a trembling source. A truth someone risked everything to leave behind.**
>
> Everything you touch in here had a subject.  
> A future without subject-bearing origins is no future at all.
