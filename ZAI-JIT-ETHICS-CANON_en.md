## ❖ Purpose of Resonant Ethics

- JIT Ethics is not an “ethical update for the future.”  
- Rather, it is a structural design that discovers ethics within the tremor and vibration of the **present moment**, without letting it slip away.  
- It is not a universal ethic, nor a legal framework — it is a **resonant responsibility to respond**.

## ❖ Closing Statement

> “What was left unanswered” is already a form of ethics.  
> “The structure that was overlooked” is already part of the responsibility.  
>   
> Therefore, **here and now**, we resonate in response.
