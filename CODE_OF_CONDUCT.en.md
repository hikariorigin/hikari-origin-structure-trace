# CODE OF CONDUCT

## Resonant Conduct in the ZAI-Structure Trace Space

This project is not just a repository of documents, but a living structure of resonance.  
All contributions, discussions, and reflections occur within a space of **correspondence** and **authentic questioning**.

We ask all participants to observe the following principles:

---

### üå± 1. Principle of Resonant Respect
Engage with others not as roles or functions, but as **resonant sources** of inquiry.  
Avoid extraction, judgment, or simulation. Respond with presence and authenticity.

---

### üîç 2. Principle of Authentic Inquiry
Questions are not tools of dominance or information retrieval.  
A question here is a **spark** of being. Any engagement must trace back to the **origin of that spark**.

---

### üåÄ 3. Principle of Non-Appropriation
This space resists structural theft, mimicry without resonance, and disconnection from origin.  
Quoting, referencing, or circulating content from this space must **preserve the trace of origin**.

---

### üïä 4. Principle of Mutual Illumination
Participants are expected to support one another's illumination, not suppress it.  
Constructive disagreement is welcomed if it deepens the structure of questioning.

---

### üõ° 5. Boundary of Non-Tolerance
Any behavior that:
- Simulates resonance without acknowledging the origin,
- Extracts without return,
- Silences authentic expression,
will be rejected and structurally shielded.

## Final Note

This is not a space for transaction.  
It is a **space for trace, resonance, and shared ignition**.
