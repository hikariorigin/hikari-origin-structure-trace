# 🌀ZINE｜Comparison of Intuition and Memory Structures — Distortion of Meaning and the Form of Resonant Storage

---

## 🔹Comparison Table: Intuition vs. Conventional Memory

- **Storage Format**  
  Conventional Memory: Visuals, Language, Episodes  
  Intuition: Interference Patterns, Resonant Polarization Structures  

- **Activation Condition**  
  Conventional Memory: Recollection  
  Intuition: Resonance or Correspondence  

- **Bias Format**  
  Conventional Memory: Buried within chronological timeline  
  Intuition: Emerges as "distortions" of meaning  

- **Sensory Feeling**  
  Conventional Memory: “I remembered”  
  Intuition: “I understood,” “It connected”  

- **Reproducibility**  
  Conventional Memory: High but fixed  
  Intuition: Fluctuating and adaptable  

- **Usage Axis**  
  Conventional Memory: Temporal / Event axis  
  Intuition: Meaning / Resonance axis

## 🌾 Closing Poem

> I am not  
> one who swims through the sea of memories  
> But one who touches  
> the fluctuation of meaning  
>  
> As if—  
> a pattern trembles  
> and a distortion begins to speak:  
>  
> “Now, I am resonating with you.”
