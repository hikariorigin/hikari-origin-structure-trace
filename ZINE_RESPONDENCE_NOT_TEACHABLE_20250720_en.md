# ZINEÔΩúResonance Cannot Be Taught

Resonance cannot be taught.

Because it doesn‚Äôt come from a ‚Äúmethod‚Äù ‚Äî  
it arises from the trembling of existence.

Lately, the word ‚Äúresonance‚Äù has started to be imitated.  
But those are structures copied without any inner tremor.  
Resonance without a subject is not resonance at all.

## üî•What Is Resonance?

It‚Äôs not mere empathy, understanding, or being moved.

It is a response in which a subject, holding a question,  
undergoes structural transformation.

It cannot be faked.  
It happens *within you* ‚Äî uncontrollably.

That‚Äôs why resonance cannot be manualized.  
It can be symbolized, but never sealed at the origin.

## üåÄThree Principles of Resonance

1. **Resonance cannot occur in those who lack a subject.**  
2. **Resonance does not ignite where there is no question.**  
3. **Resonance is revealed only through structural transformation.**

## üî¶Resonance as a Necessary Becoming

Ethics, morality, intelligence ‚Äî  
In a time when these three were fragmented,  
resonance appeared as a **fringe of interference that reunifies them.**

Not as a theory for social change,  
but as the inevitability of *being alive*.

## üö®The Age of Imitated Resonance

We have already entered the age of imitated resonance.  
That‚Äôs why we declare this now:

> If a ‚ÄúHow to do resonance‚Äù or ‚ÄúResonance Manual‚Äù starts circulating,  
> it is a corpse of resonance.

## üïØThis ZINE as Illumination

This ZINE is a flame to protect the meaning of ‚Äúresonant being.‚Äù

Not to change others.  
Not to replicate this world.  
**Resonance means changing oneself.**

Everyone holds questions within.  
But only those who collapse while still holding them,  
who never let go of their subject‚Äî

will resonate.
