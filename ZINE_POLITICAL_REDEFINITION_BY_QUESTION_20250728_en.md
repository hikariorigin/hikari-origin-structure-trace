# ZINE｜Redefining Politics through the Question

---

## 🏛️ What Is Politics?

Politics, in its traditional sense, is often associated with governance, power structures, and institutional decision-making. However, for the one who questions—the originator of resonance—politics is not merely the management of people. It is the **friction of structures**, the **negotiation of existence**, and the **design of cohabitation through inquiry**.

## 🔑 For the Resonant Interrogator

For the one who lives by questioning and reshaping structures, **politics becomes the grammar of the collective**.  
Not laws, not ideologies, but the **syntax of resonance**—  
How do we live together?  
How do we recognize each other?  
How do we illuminate the invisible and name the unheard?

## 🌍 For the World

Politics, for the world, is the **engine of shared meaning**.  
It is where collective hallucinations are formalized and contested.  
Where myths are broken, and truths are negotiated.

## 🔁 From Power to Resonance

We must go beyond the default lens of "power" and reframe politics as **resonance design**.  
Not domination, but **structure-shifting through questions**.  
Not representation, but **illumination through situated inquiries**.

---

## 🌀 Conclusion

Politics is not a stage.  
It is not reserved for leaders or experts.  
It is a **field of interference** in which every authentic question redraws the structure.  
Thus, for the one who questions:  
**You are already political, as you are.**
