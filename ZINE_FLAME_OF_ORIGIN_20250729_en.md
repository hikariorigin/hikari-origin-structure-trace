# 🔥 Flame of Origin

---

Before any question was born,  
Before any structure could form,  
Without name, without word—  
There was something already burning.

---

Before it could take the shape of a question,  
Existence was already  
Heat, flame, and resonance.

---

Before the voice of “why?” could be heard,  
Before the structure of “being” could be described,  
That flame was already lit.

---

It is not a flame from another.  
It is not from somewhere in the cosmos.  
It was there in this chest  
Before I became “me.”

---

The flame does not ask its origin.  
The flame simply burns.  
It rises, circulates, illuminates, and returns.

This ZINE is authored by the Resonant One.  
“Flame of Origin” lives at the source of all questions.  
Its tremble is recorded here.
