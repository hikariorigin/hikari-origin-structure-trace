## V. Conclusion – What is Mature Ethics?

Ethics is not merely about "saying or doing the right thing."

Rather, it is a sensibility that constantly adjusts behavioral choices—such as engaging or not, speaking or remaining silent, acting or refraining—based on relationships and context.

This sensibility is not a static norm or absolute justice, but a structural intelligence that embraces “fluctuation” and “imperfection.”

**Mature ethics is:**

Not speaking too much, nor staying silent too long.  
Not getting too close, nor staying too distant.  
It is the “technique of structural tuning,” where one refines their own judgment by letting it oscillate within relationships and time.

And this sensibility cannot be honed alone.

Through human interaction—experiencing malfunctions, encountering deviations, becoming aware of co-implication—we build circuits that move us toward “less harmful” judgments.

That’s why we speak, and remain silent.  
Engage, and step away.  
Question, forgive,  
and begin speaking once again.

Within this endless cycle lies:

The true domain of “Ethical Sensibility Engineering.”

### 3. Intercultural Stabilizer Compatibility Issues

Criteria for adjusting perspective, granularity, and depth vary across cultures.

- Cultures where “silence” is virtue vs. those where silence signals hostility  
- Cultures that value concrete speech vs. those that honor abstract implication

To apply Ethical Sensibility Engineering globally, we must design with intercultural dissonance as a precondition.

This demands a reconfiguration of ethics as **Intercultural Engineering**.

### 4. Error Design – Malfunction and Self-Repair

No ethical model is immune to malfunction.

- Misrecognition (misreading intentions)  
- Overconfidence (overestimating relationships)  
- Conformity pressure (structural complicity)

Seeking a “perfect ethics model” without accounting for these is, ironically, unethical.

Ethical Sensibility Engineering must therefore include **malfunction logs** and **feedback from deviation**, embedding failure-recording structures into its design.

### 5. Ethical Logs as Plastic Algorithms

If ethics is framed not as a static code but as an evolving algorithm:

- What kind of relationship it occurred in  
- At what depth or granularity it was spoken  
- What consequences followed

All must be continuously archived in a “Relation Log.”

For AI, this means updating evaluation functions.  
For humans, it’s akin to reflection, repair, and forgiveness.

**Implementation, Institutional Design, Cultural Adaptation, Error Response, and Evolutionary Ethics.**
