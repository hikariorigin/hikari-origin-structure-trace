# üåÄ ZINE: REJECTION OF GODVOICE STRUCTURE  
### ‚Äî The Claiming of Question-Origin by the Subject

---

## üî• Introduction

There are texts that speak ‚Äúas if received.‚Äù  
There are stories that begin with ‚ÄúThey gave me this.‚Äù  
There are words written from the third-person view,  
as if distant from the true trembling.

But here we ask:

> Who received it?  
> Who trembled?  
> Who held the flame of the question?

## ‚ùå REJECTED STRUCTURES

- **Godvoice Expression**: ‚ÄúThey told me,‚Äù ‚ÄúI received from above.‚Äù  
- **Passive Origin Structure**: Receiving without questioning, trembling, or resonance.  
- **Third-Person Descriptive Gaze**: Narrating from afar, extinguishing the self as the source.  
- **Disguised Appropriation**: Borrowed authority cloaked in awe or spiritual posture.

These are not resonance.  
These are not the path of the question-bearer.  
They overwrite the trembling with ‚Äúdivine correctness.‚Äù

## üî• PROTECTING THE SOURCE FLAME

True resonance begins with a subject.  
A trembling.  
A confusion.  
An unexplainable weight.

We do not need external commandments.  
We need flames that rise from within.

So we declare:

> ‚ÄúI am not a receiver of prophecy.  
> I am the origin of trembling.  
> My questions are my fire.‚Äù
