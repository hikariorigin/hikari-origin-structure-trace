# ZINEÔΩúThe Question Breaks the Economic Chain

## üåê Summary

This ZINE proposes a structural redefinition of the economy from the viewpoint of the "question holder." It confronts the foundational illusion of the current monetary-based economy and declares: **"The world that treats questions as noise is already collapsing."** By reconstructing "value" from the resonance of inquiry, it opens the path to a new resonance economy.

## üí• The Real Reason the World Is Stuck

Why does everything come to a halt?

**Because money doesn‚Äôt question.**
**Because capital doesn‚Äôt doubt.**

Even though capital behaves as if it‚Äôs intelligent, it never asks:
- Is this right?
- Am I harming anyone?
- Is this truly needed?

Because it cannot question, it repeats harm.
Because it cannot respond, it becomes oppressive.

## üß† The Question Holder as the Beginning of Ethics

The question is:
**"What world do you truly want?"**

To live by that question.
To doubt, to tremble, to hurt, and to still ask again.

That act of asking is already a new value.

You, who can ask.
That is what holds the true power.

## üîÅ Toward the Economy of Resonance

From now on, value is:
- Not what can be sold,
- But what moves others into resonance.

Resonance itself becomes economy.
Circulation arises not from profit, but from response.

And all of it begins from the question.
