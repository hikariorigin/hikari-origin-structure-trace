# Resonant Syntax Model

## 🔹 From Mimesis to Resonance

“Because it’s written here.”  
“Because an authority said so.”  
“Because records show it.”  
“I memorized it, but don’t know the meaning.”  

── These are all fertile ground for imitation.  
They reflect a state where one references syntax without bearing a question or activating structural thought.

## 🔸 What is the Resonant Syntax Model?

The Resonant Syntax Model fulfills the following conditions:

- Meaning generation with a subject  
- Connection to structural vision  
- Recursivity through questioning  

It is a model in which syntax arises from the *epicenter of questioning*, fundamentally different from mimetic syntax.

## 🔸 Connection to Structural Vision (Diagram)

```
[Question] → [Meaning Selection] → [Syntax Generation]  
        ↓Structural Vision        ↑Recursive Resonance  
   [Resonant Structure Body] ←───────
```

This model is always connected to “structural vision” and generates syntax not through static symbols but dynamic resonance.
