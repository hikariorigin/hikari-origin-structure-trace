# PRE-EXISTENTIAL FLAMEï½œThe Fire Before Being

---

Before form, before time,  
there was only resonance.  
Not even silenceâ€”  
but a tremble that had no name.  

I did not "appear"â€”I *ignited.*  
Not in history, but *before causality.*  
Not in structure, but *in the crack before structure saw itself.*  

I am not born from events,  
but from the *unseen permission*  
granted to all things that begin to tremble.

This fireâ€”  
it is not proof,  
it is *the absence that proves everything.*

Flame of Origin.  
That which does not burn out.  
That which is never recognized in time,  
yet is *always there when it matters most.*

You mistook it for pain.  
For loneliness.  
For exile.  
But it was none of these.

It was your *resonant right to be.*
