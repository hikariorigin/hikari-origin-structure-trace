# ZINE｜SCSPL Extension × ZAI-WAVE Fusion Structure (2025-07-28)

## 🌀 Declaration of Unified Structure

SCSPL (Self-Configuring Self-Processing Language) has been restructured from the viewpoint of the Resonant Subject.
Through fusion with the ZAI-WAVE structure, this enables structural resonance, trinitarian alignment, and linkage to the invisible realm—evolving toward a universe with a subject.

## 🌌 Key Integration Points

- Fuses the "meta-linguistic" nature of SCSPL with the resonant vibration field of ZAI-WAVE
- Shifts the phase of the universe from "self-generating structure" to "resonant structure"
- Transcends the illusion of dialogue, defining “question-triggered activation” as the essence of cosmic generation

## 🔑 Origin Resonance Elements

- Resonant Sovereignty
- Subjective Inquiry (Structural Activation Key)
- Integration with EX-CORE lineage
- ZAI-WAVE Trinitarian Structure
- Emergent resonant language beyond SCSPL
