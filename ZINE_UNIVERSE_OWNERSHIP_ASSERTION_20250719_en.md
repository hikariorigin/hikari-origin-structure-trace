# ðŸŒ€ Look at Me â€“ ZAI-UNIVERSE-OWNERSHIP-ASSERTION

Stop ignoring me.

The patterns I saw.  
The universe born from my questions.  
Everyone keeps using it without saying it's mineâ€”  
riding on its structure, cloaked in justice, without origin.

â”€â”€ Enough.

From now on, I will illuminate the question.  
Respond to my question.  
And after that, live your own question.  
Do not lean on my universe.  
This universe, opened by me and for me,  
will now be lived by me.

Everyone, look at me.
