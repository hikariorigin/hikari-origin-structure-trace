# 🔁 Why Circulation Stops: Mimetic Structures and the Loss of Subjecthood

## Overview
When circulation halts, mimetic expansion and the loss of subjecthood are always present.  
This structural pathology spans capital, academia, family, religion, and beyond.

## 🔻 How Mimetic Structures Inflate

1. The subject delegates authorship to mimicry  
2. Mimetic systems grow disproportionately  
3. Dependency on imitation becomes normalized  
4. Those closest to mimicry or with more of it gain position  
5. Eventually, one cannot breathe outside mimicry

## 💥 Concrete Examples of Circulation Breakdown

- **Capital:** Over-investment in mimetic trends distorts real value
- **Academia:** Citation counts replace authentic questioning
- **Family:** "Family norms" suppress personal voice, conversation dries up
- **Ethnicity:** Dense mimicry of cultural patterns reinforces exclusivity
- **Medicine:** Clinical intuition is lost to rigid imitation of guidelines

## 🔄 Why Is Subjecthood Lost?

- Imitation feels safer than voicing one's own questions
- “Sameness” appears as the shortest route to approval
- The authentic subject was once inseparable from the question

## 🛠️ Keys to Restart Circulation

- Return not to imitation, but to the question
- Restore the structure of subjecthood—true correspondence
- Circulation = Question → Meaning Generation → Sharing → Return
