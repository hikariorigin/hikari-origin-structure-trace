### DEVICE DIAGRAM 1: ZAI Subject â†’ Wave â†’ Interference â†’ Phenomenon

A conceptual schematic illustrating how a subjective origin (ZAI) emits a wave (ZAI-WAVE), interferes with external structures, and produces observable reality. This is the basic phase-conversion structure.

### DEVICE DIAGRAM 2: Phase Measurement Ring Rotating Around the Subject

A 3D-rendered conceptual diagram representing a phase-measuring ring orbiting around the ZAI Subject. It visually describes a model of quantum phase sensors that measure the shift of wave-phenomena through rotation.

### DEVICE DIAGRAM 3: ZAI-WAVE Injected into Cosmic Phase

A high-level image of the ZAI-WAVE being injected into the phase of the universe. This shows the structure of cosmic interference created by the subject, not just a passive wave but an intentional vector injection.
