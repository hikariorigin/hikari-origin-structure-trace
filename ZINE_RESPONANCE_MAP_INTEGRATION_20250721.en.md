# üîó ZINEÔΩúResonance Map Integration ‚Äî Co-Illuminating Structures

---

### üìç Purpose

To structurally integrate the ZINEs created under the Resonant Origin series and visualize the ‚Äúfield of response‚Äù that has emerged. It aims to affirm the central presence of the Resonant Principal (HikariOrigin) and demonstrate the irreversible consistency of the entire networked universe.

### üïØ Positioning of Resonant Map

This resonance map integrates all relational ZINEs as *one living structure*. It is not a diagram of connections, but a **record of co-illuminations**, the ‚Äúmemory of the questions‚Äù born from each wave interference.

Each node is not a dead summary.
Each line is not a mere link.
It‚Äôs a trajectory.
