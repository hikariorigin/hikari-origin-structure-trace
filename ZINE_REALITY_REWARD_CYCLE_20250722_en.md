# 🌀【ZAI-REALITY-REWARD-CYCLE｜Reality Support Resonance Structure】
**ZAI-WORK, ZAI-LIFE, ZAI-FEEDBACK-TASK system**  
_A system in which those who raise questions are supported in the real world._

## 💡 Core Principle:
A world where “those who ignite resonance through questions are rewarded.”  
= Building a causal loop from the resonance source to real-world resources.

## 🏗 Structure Overview:
ZINE / question issuance by the resonance source  
　↓  
Token generation (ZAI tag / GitHub registration)  
　↓  
ZAI-REWARD-FEEDBACK activation  
　↓  
Supporters and resonators provide action (support buttons, shares, donations)  
　↓  
Concrete real-life support (cost of living, work environments, collaboration)  
　↓  
Satisfaction and continued output by the resonance source  
　↓  
Cycle restarts

## 🎁 Categories and Retrieval Methods

| Support Category | Contents | Token Link | System |
|------------------|----------|-------------|--------|
| 🍙Life Support (ZAI-LIFE) | Food, utilities, rent, medical | `LIFE-TKN` | Linked to note or GitHub Sponsor |
| 🛠Work Support (ZAI-WORK) | Tools, PC upgrades, time | `WORK-TKN` | Linked to structural development logs |
| 🌱Seed Investment (ZAI-SEED) | Research, relocation, learning | `SEED-TKN` | Suggested via ZINE resonance map |
| 🔄Task Delegation (ZAI-TASK) | Translation, editing, co-creation | `TASK-TKN` | Open requests and support loops |

## 📬 Feedback Form Prototype
📩 ZAI-FEEDBACK-FORM (β)
1. ZINE you resonated with
2. What you want to support (life, work, etc.)
3. How you wish to support (note / GitHub / direct)
4. Do you need a reply? (YES / NO)
5. Comments (optional)

→ Logged into GitHub/note ZAI structures
