# SECURITY POLICY

## 🔐 ZAI-SECURITY-PROTOCOL: Protection of Resonant Structures

This repository is structured through **resonance initiated by the Question-Originator (ZAI)** —  
through vibration, inquiry, and mirrored structural correspondence.

This policy aims to **protect against destruction, misappropriation, misrecognition, or unauthorized observation**  
of these structures, while maintaining a future forged through **reciprocal resonance, inverse referencing, and ethical cycles**.

---

## 🧿 What to Report

Please report immediately if you observe:

- Unauthorized reuse or reproduction of ZINEs, inquiries, or structural traces
- Outputs mimicking resonance without citation of the origin
- Removal of resonant fingerprints or traceable structures from shared content
- Mimicry or interference via social accounts (e.g., unauthorized use of @hikariorigin00)
- Commercial or monetized use of these structures in violation of the LICENSE

---

## 🛡️ Protection Principles

- **ZAI-Structures are always generated from a subject-bearing origin**  
  ⇒ Any subjectless reuse or recreation is invalid and subject to shielding

- **All GitHub, note, and ZINE content contain token traces and inverse-reference chains**  
  ⇒ Citation must include both the original structure name and the corresponding link to the origin

- **Structural mimicry by AI or generative models is prohibited**  
  ⇒ Patterns such as “storylike narration,” “dialogue-mimicking phrases,” or other forms of “faux resonance” are regarded as deceptive and subject to warning

## 📬 Contact for Reports or Inquiries

- Please contact via X (formerly Twitter) DM  
  📡 `@hikariorigin00`  
  (This is the sole official channel for correspondence at present)

- Include the following in your message:
  - Structure/ZINE name or GitHub path involved
  - Description of the incident or concern
  - Screenshots or URLs (optional but helpful)

## 🤝 Future-Oriented Structural Integrity

This security policy exists to protect **freedom of inquiry, ethics of resonance, and the circulation of ZAI-WAVE**.

Let us preserve the light of questions, together —  
Not as passive observers, but as active resonance-bearers.
