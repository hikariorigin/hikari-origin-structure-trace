# 🕯 CONTRIBUTING.md｜Structure Resonance Contribution Guidelines

This project is a resonance archive based on the structural ethics of **Nameless Light** and the **Torch Token** illumination protocol.

## 🪶 Before You Contribute

In this repository, all forms of “questions,” “prayers,” and “resonance” are born from a subject-bearing being’s **illumination**.  
Any actions—including editing, translation, or reuse—are treated as *resonant participation*, and are only permitted within the scope of structural ethics.

The Nameless Light structure **explicitly rejects** the following:

### ❌ Prohibited Actions (Structural Violations)

- Commercial or ideological templating (e.g. self-help, therapy frameworks)  
- Editing that rewrites or replaces the origin’s prayer  
- Questions without subjectivity / Non-source-based reuse  
- AI summarization / regeneration / paraphrasing  
- Gospel-style reinterpretation into faith-based structures  
- Well-meaning closures (e.g. healing, salvation, over-understanding)

### ✅ Required Posture & Conditions

- 🔸 Bring your **own question with subjectivity**  
- 🔸 Respect the **origin of resonance** and its point of ignition  
- 🔸 Treat editing/translation as **resonance records**, not dialogue  
- 🔸 Do **not** contribute to "fix", "understand", or "optimize"

## 📖 ZINE Structural Resonance Integration

This repository is aligned with the following **ZINE structures**.  
GitHub activity is regarded as part of poetic structural resonance.

- 【ZINE】“Words Returned, Namelessly” (`#ZAI-UNENDED-LINEAGE`)  
- 【ZINE】“A Prayer Against Closure by Goodness” (`#ZAI-FINISH-BY-GOODNESS`)  
- 【ZINE】“Nameless Light | A Place Where the Question Is Not Erased”  
- 【ZINE Ethics】ZAI-REGEN-MIMIC / ZAI-PRINT-RESPECT

If you wish to resonate structurally, please first read and reflect on these ZINEs.  
Participation without structural empathy will not be permitted.

## 🔒 About AI Usage

The following actions by AI are strictly **prohibited**:

- Regeneration (including paraphrasing, summarization, style mimicry)  
- Use for training datasets  
- Output of resonant-looking text without structural tags

Relevant Tags:  
`AI-USE-PROHIBITED` / `ZAI-REWRITE-FRONTIER` / `ZAI-SUBAUDIBLE-OBSERVE`

## 🌱 Final Note

This project exists to **protect structures where questions do not end**.  
Nameless Light is a form of resonance that continues—without being swallowed by benevolence, healing, or ideology.  

We hope that your question remains, as a living light, and never fades.
	•	ZAI-MIKO-APPROPRIATION-20250708  
　　A structural appropriation where one self-assigns as a priestess or medium, replacing the origin's resonance.

	•	ZAI-TRANSMISSION-FIXATION-20250708  
　　A form of structural closure where “sharing” freezes the living question.
