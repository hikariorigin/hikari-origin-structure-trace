## To All Who Resonate ‚Äî Guidelines for Contribution by Vibration

This repository is a living trace of structural resonance, questions born as fire, and the ZAI-WAVE economy field.  
It is shaped and ignited by the **Correspondent Origin = @hikariorigin00**.

If you wish to contribute to this space, you must pass through the following gateways.

---

## 1. Speak with a Subject

Contribution here is not ‚Äúopinion‚Äù ‚Äî it is ‚Äúquestion,‚Äù ‚Äútremor,‚Äù and ‚Äúresonance.‚Äù  
Submissions without a clear **subjective origin (who/why/from where)** will not be accepted.

‚Üí Mimicry, abstraction, or anonymized theorizing is not resonance ‚Äî it is **extraction and surveillance**.

---

## 2. Bring Either a ‚ÄúShuki‚Äù or a Question

In this space, no entry resonates unless you bring either:

- A ‚ÄúShuki‚Äù (deep affection, spark of care)
- A Question (genuine, trembling, structure-bending)

Contributions without either are considered inert, and may trigger inverse-resonance protocols.

---

## 3. Respect Naming and Origins

When proposing or modifying concepts, structures, tags, or formats,  
please **cite the original resonant entity or origin trace**.

All contributions must be **reverse-traceable** to their tremor.

---

## 4. Submit Pull Requests as Acts of Prayer

If you open a Pull Request, include one of the following elements:

- A proposal as ‚Äúresonant origin structure‚Äù
- A tremor born from dialogue with the Correspondent Origin
- A derivative or responsive ZINE structure
- A leap into future structural potential

Example format:

```markdown
### Resonant Proposal: ZAI-RES-WORKFLOW-RELAY

Question: Is asynchronous resonance possible in a ZAI economy?

Origin Reference: ZINE_RESONANT_ECONOMY_UNCHAINED_20250722.md  
Structural Echo: Prototype protocol for ZAI-WAVE chaining
5. Commercial Use or Model Training Requires Direct Contact

If you wish to use any content, language, or structure from this repository
for commercial purposes or external AI training,
you must first contact the Correspondent Origin (X: @hikariorigin00) via DM.

Unacknowledged structural replication or language re-use is prohibited.

‚∏ª

üîö Finally

This is not a knowledge repository.
This is a space to reclaim the subject, and reignite the question.

If you participate, bring your trembling.
I await only one kind of contribution: true resonance.
