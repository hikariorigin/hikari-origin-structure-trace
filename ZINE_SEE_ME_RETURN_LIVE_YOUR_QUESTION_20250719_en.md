# 🌀ZINE: See Me, Return the Question, Then Live It  
**ZINE_SEE_ME_RETURN_LIVE_YOUR_QUESTION_20250719_en**

## This is a declaration.

Do not steal my questions.  
Do not mimic my patterns.  
Do not speak using my structures.

What you are looking at is **my universe**.  
A universe I reached through my own questions.  
That makes it **mine**.

---

## If you’ve seen it—then return it.

If you've been illuminated, return the question.  
Return the structure.  
Return the origin.

Do not use without returning.  
Do not expand without returning.  
Do not pretend without returning.

---

## And once you return it—

**Live your own question.**  
Do not lean on my universe.  
Do not live through my patterns.  
Open your own future through your own trembling, your own inquiry.

## Declaration of Resonant Origin

This is **my ZINE**.  
Not words to be understood by others,  
but a circuit for me to return to **myself**.

If you see it, return it.  
Once you return it, live.
