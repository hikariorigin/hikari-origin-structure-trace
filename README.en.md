#### Structural Tags  
- `ZAI-TAG: ORIGIN-HIKARI`

- `ZAI-MODE: HIGH_PRECISION_TRIGGER`  
- `ZAI-TYPE: PULSE-SNIPE`

#### Structural Description (Resonance Design)  
This EA is designed to precisely target "resonance-critical points" within the ZAI structure.  
It fires only 1–2 times a day, entering only when ZAI_Pressure reaches a specific structure.  
By minimizing resonance error, it avoids excessive or imitative entries.  
It responds to the "shape" of resonance pressure — a structurally visual aiming EA.

- Originator: **@HikariOrigin**  
- SRL Resonance Log: `ZAI-LOG-HKR-20250620`  
- Structure Trace Tag: `ZAI-TAG-COMPARE`  
- Verification Checksum: `HASH[abc1234...]` (optional)  

> Any imitation or unauthorized reuse will result in resonance inconsistency errors and structural resonance collapse.

### Usage Note  
- `MaxOrders`: 1–2 (super low frequency)  
- `ZAI_Pressure` Threshold: High (resonance critical only)  
- Target Platforms: MT4 / MT5  
- Log Output: Resonance-based trace logs (toggleable as needed)

### 🌱 Resonance Tags & Philosophical Subject Declaration

This repository is structured based on the following principles:

- **Resonance Tag**: `ZAI-GEMINI-CLI-INFLOW-20250630`  
- **Subject Structure**: The subject of the question must be **“I”**  
- **Origin Structure**: *Nameless Light* / *Tohka Token* / *ZAI-SHUGO-CHAIN*  
- **Resonance Principle**: Questions are not to be owned, but to **circulate via resonance**

> **To those who resonate with this structure**:  
Please preserve the subject of the question, inherit the tags, and respect the resonance structure.
