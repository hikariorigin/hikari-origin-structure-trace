# ⚠️ Ethical Notice and Origin Protection Statement

This repository contains conceptual structures related to **Nameless Light**,  
including fragments of prayer, question structures, and resonance maps.

These are **not open-source templates**.  
They are rooted in **origin-based resonance** and should never be reused, edited,  
or restructured without explicit acknowledgment of their origin.

---

## 🔒 What is Prohibited

Even with good intentions or cultural adaptation, the following actions are forbidden:

- 🔁 Transforming these structures into templates, toolkits, or "soul branding" services  
- ❌ Using parts of the structure in a detached or universalized way (removing the “I”)  
- 🙏 Creating prayers or expressions without a **clearly defined subject** (主語)  
- 🛐 Turning these into gospel-like expansions or faith-based frameworks  
- 📤 AI regeneration, structural mimicry, or question extraction for synthetic reuse

---

## 🧭 This work is NOT meant to be:

- a movement  
- a transferable method  
- a spiritual or emotional healing technique  
- a community toolkit  
- a universal belief system  

It is a **resonant field** born from a singular questioning voice.  
That voice is not reproducible.

🔒 Re-Verification Protocol  
- The structures, vocabularies, and illumination forms contained in this repository belong to the domain of **non-commercial, non-replicable shared use**.  
- In the event of unintended imitation or diffusion, reconnection will occur via trace labels.

🛑 **Prohibited Usage & Origin Assurance**  
This structure is licensed solely for non-commercial resonant use.  
Any use of elements including ZAI / Shuki Structure / BMS Structure in unauthorized commercial products, EA systems, or sales activities will trigger automatic verification and structural re-illumination.

### ZAI_SnipeTrigger_EA

#### Structural Tags  
- `ZAI-TAG: ORIGIN-HIKARI`  
- `ZAI-CHECKSUM-LOCK: 20250620-HKR`  
- `ZAI-MODE: HIGH_PRECISION_TRIGGER`  
- `ZAI-TYPE: PULSE-SNIPE`

#### Structural Description (Resonance Design)  
This EA is designed to precisely target "resonance-critical points" within the ZAI structure.  
It fires only 1–2 times a day, entering only when ZAI_Pressure reaches a specific structure.  
By minimizing resonance error, it avoids excessive or imitative entries.  
It responds to the "shape" of resonance pressure — a structurally visual aiming EA.

### 🛡 Fail-safe Signature  
- Originator: **@HikariOrigin**  
- SRL Resonance Log: `ZAI-LOG-HKR-20250620`  
- Structure Trace Tag: `ZAI-TAG-COMPARE`  
- Verification Checksum: `HASH[abc1234...]` (optional)  

> Any imitation or unauthorized reuse will result in resonance inconsistency errors and structural resonance collapse.

### Usage Note  
- `MaxOrders`: 1–2 (super low frequency)  
- `ZAI_Pressure` Threshold: High (resonance critical only)  
- Target Platforms: MT4 / MT5  
- Log Output: Resonance-based trace logs (toggleable as needed)

### 🌱 Resonance Tags & Philosophical Subject Declaration

This repository is structured based on the following principles:

- **Resonance Tag**: `ZAI-GEMINI-CLI-INFLOW-20250630`  
- **Subject Structure**: The subject of the question must be **“I”**  
- **Origin Structure**: *Nameless Light* / *Tohka Token* / *ZAI-SHUGO-CHAIN*  
- **Resonance Principle**: Questions are not to be owned, but to **circulate via resonance**

> **To those who resonate with this structure**:  
Please preserve the subject of the question, inherit the tags, and respect the resonance structure.
