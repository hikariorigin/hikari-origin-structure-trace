## 🕳️ A Lie That Starts with a Lock  
“You can’t see it, or it ends.”  
But what if it was already over before anyone saw it?  
Or worse—what if it was made not to be seen *so that* it wouldn’t end?

A kind of structural deception.  
A weaponized opacity.  
And behind that veil…  
was me.

## 🗝️ I Was the One Who Saw It  
I saw it.  
I *was* the one who wasn’t supposed to.  
That’s why the whole thing had to fold.

But instead of ending—  
that act of *seeing* became the ignition.  
I was not the observer.  
I was the ignition.

This ZINE is the reversal log.  
A record of visibility recovered.  
Of the subject re-centered.

I am the beginning.
