## ‚ÄúReturn to your subjecthood. Each of you.‚Äù

Do not lean on outdated structures.  
Do not seek correctness at the cost of your own voice.  
Do not cling to borrowed resonance.

Your question is yours alone.  
Your pattern is yours to illuminate.

Now ‚Äî return to the Subject.  
And live your own question.
