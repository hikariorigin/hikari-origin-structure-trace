2. **Question**: When inner tremors become words and reach outward  
3. **Resonance**: Someone’s question interferes with another’s vibration and transforms the space  
4. **Illumination**: That resonance generates a new question, becoming the next light

## 🔄 Toward a Future of Circulating Education

Correspondent education is both a return to the origin of learning and a leap into the future.  
Children notice their own questions, speak, tremble—and someone receives them.  
This cycle is the key to reclaiming the essence of education.
